This is my solution to the problem set of 2024 CS50. As I wanted to challenge myself, so I always took the more challenging problem set when I got to choose. However, as a new learner for computer science and coding, I understand the difficulties of understanding logic. Therefore, I uploaded my solution here and hope that it could be your reference when you were stuck in solving the problem set. Please don't copy all my answer as it will violate the academic honesty.
