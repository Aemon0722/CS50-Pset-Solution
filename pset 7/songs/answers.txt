Question 1:

I would describle the audio aura as quite energetic and active as the average energy and danceability of top 100 song is around 0.66 and 0.72 respectively.
However, the valence is quite mixed as its valence only have around 0.48

Question 2:
I think danceability and energy are more correlated as song with strong energy are easier to incite people to dance. However, valence related to the music positivity,
which may not have a high correlation with energy as energy with danceability, or sometimes could contradict with enery and danceability.
As a result, there may be a profile that the listener tend to listen with sad or angry song but have a high energy and danceability. I will propose to include the weight of
the most play song in the calculation, the higher the rank, the higher the weight of that song is. This will better reflect the listener audio aura.
